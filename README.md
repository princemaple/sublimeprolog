# Mercury syntax highlighting for Sublime Text #

This package provides syntax highlighting for the logic
programming language Mercury. It is highly work in progress, so use with care.

### To Do ###
* Build system
* Syntax check & fix

## Installation ##
**Not yet**

## Credit ##
It's said that Mercury inherits the syntax from prolog, so I forked this repo from [SublimeProlog](https://github.com/alnkpa/sublimeprolog)
